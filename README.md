# 💫 About Me:
Tanzeef Ahamed: Junior Health Informatics Specialist<br><br>As a Health Informatics Technology Excel to transform the complexity of health data into digestible and actionable insights for better informing planning and decision-making. <br><br>My practical experience includes application development (Java, C#, React, Node.js, and SQL) and use of practical health applications including OpenEMR and Iguana. I enjoy working on both: whether it is addressing Ontario Vital Statistics data to analyze demographic trends, or drafting a multiplication chart generator, I thrive on challenging assignments; recognizing the underlying issue and employing intelligent and efficient solutions. <br><br>Beyond programming and data preparedness I am comfortable as a team member. I am passionate about engagement in an active, multi-cultural environment and I am able to respond calmly yet critically to engagement challenges. My experiences working with logistics for events, even as a Cricket Tournament Ball Boy or as a volunteer in support of my community events, have further built my commitment to articulation skills such as listening actively, communicating clearly, and acting as a part of team support for a successful outcome. I look forward to using my skills to enhance IT solutions and clinical workflows at a very professional level.
