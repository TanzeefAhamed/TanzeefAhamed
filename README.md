# üí´ About Me:
Tanzeef Ahamed: Junior Health Informatics Specialist<br><br>As a Health Informatics Technology student, I am a self-motivated and adaptable person who believes in the power of data and software to improve healthcare outcomes. My technical foundation is built on using tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to transform the complexity of health data into digestible and actionable insights for better informing planning and decision-making. <br><br>My practical experience includes application development (Java, C#, React, Node.js, and SQL) and use of practical health applications including OpenEMR and Iguana. I enjoy working on both: whether it is addressing Ontario Vital Statistics data to analyze demographic trends, or drafting a multiplication chart generator, I thrive on challenging assignments; recognizing the underlying issue and employing intelligent and efficient solutions. <br><br>Beyond programming and data preparedness I am comfortable as a team member. I am passionate about engagement in an active, multi-cultural environment and I am able to respond calmly yet critically to engagement challenges. My experiences working with logistics for events, even as a Cricket Tournament Ball Boy or as a volunteer in support of my community events, have further built my commitment to articulation skills such as listening actively, communicating clearly, and acting as a part of team support for a successful outcome. I look forward to using my skills to enhance IT solutions and clinical workflows at a very professional level.
